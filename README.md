# Kanban Template

## What is this for?

One of the most important parts about being a team lead is having a method for tracking the issues the team will tackle during the semester. This achieves three goals:
1. Creating a concrete, actionable plan for achieving the semester's deliverables
2. Tracking progress towards those deliverables
3. Tracking member progress and success

This tempate is a good starting point for creating an issue tracker for your team.

## What is a Kanban Board?

The idea of a Kanban board is to create an easy mechanism for tracking each issue (or ticket, or story, whatever you want to call it...) the team will work on to complete a project. 

The board is organized as a sequence of columns. Each 'issue' your team will work on as a part of the project begins on the leftmost side, in the 'backlog' or 'todos'. As the issue progresses, it marches across the board, to 'In Development', 'In PR/Review', and finally, 'Done'. In that way, these boards make it easy to determine what's finished, what's left to do, and what's currently in progress for your team.
